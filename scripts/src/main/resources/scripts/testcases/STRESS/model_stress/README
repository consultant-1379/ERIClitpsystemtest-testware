To Run model stress SOAK
=========================
1. Make an output directory for the backup 
	mkdir /tmp/test_backup
2. Copy stress_soak files over to a MS
	scp model_stress/* root@10.44.235.150:/tmp
3. Add the following cronjob by running 'crontab -e' :
	* * * * * /opt/ericsson/nms/litp/bin/litp_state_backup.sh /tmp/test_backup
4. In the directory you copied files to, run "sh submitter.sh"
5. Output of the stress soak is sent to /tmp/
	tail -f /tmp/stress_soak.out


model_stress/submitter.sh - issues following in repeated loop (up to 200000 times)
1. create package-list, create package, remove package-list via CLI
2. create package-list, create package, remove package-list via REST
3. create package-list via REST, create package via load XMl, remove package-list via REST


5 rubbish XML loaded
====================
01 loads an XML package with a property name that doesn't exits
    InvalidXMLError    Element 'donotexist': This element is not expected. Expected is one of ( release, repository, version )., line 4
02 loads an XML file with incorrect tag
    InvalidRequestError    Premature end of data in tag package line 2, line 4, column 1
03 loads an XML file with an invalid location in heading
    InvalidXMLError    Element '{http://www.ericsson.com/litp}package', attribute '{http:///2001/XMLSchema-instance}schemaLocation': The attribute '{http:///2001/XMLSchema-instance}schemaLocation' is not allowed., line 2
04 loads an XML file that try changes a readonly property (not updatable by plugin)

05 loads an XML file that trys changes a readonly property (updatable by plugin)

06 Load XML package into incorrect location 

07 Load XML package into location where we not allowed to load XML (/plans/plan)

08 Try load incomplete XMl file with merge

09 Try load incomplete XMl file with replace

10 Try load command with incorrect argument

Checks - run the below to see if they are any errors during soak
================================================================

grep  Error /tmp/stress_soak.out | grep -v "line 2" | grep -v "line 4"  | grep -v BAD_CLI  | grep -v '1.4.2@' | grep -v 'NOT-pac' | grep -v 'Unable to modify readonly property' | grep -v "expected '>', line 7" | grep -v 'is not an allowed child of /ms' | grep -v 'unrecognized arguments: --Incarg' | grep -v "InvalidLocationError    Not Found"

grep -i 'Unrecoverable error in the server' /tmp/stress_soak.out

Check for any mentions of traceback errors,failed or Error in the messages file. There may be results from before the beginning of the model stress which can be discarded.
Expected:
	Traceback from TORF-192343 may be seen
grep  -i Traceb /var/log/messages --color
grep -v "RegexError: '1.4.2@'" /var/log/messages | grep -v DEBUG|grep -i error --color
grep -v 'INFO: XML load failed' /var/log/messages | grep -v DEBUG|grep -i failed --color


List open files in use by litp from stress_soak.out file . 
At the time of writing this (2.50.3) the number of open files is 144.

cat stress_soak.out | grep -i losf_file_count | grep -v echo    (Note the loop_count as this can be used later in rate_per_hour)

Check the expected number of backups exist under /tmp
ls -l /tmp/test_backup  (Should be no more than 5 backup files present)

Ensure the expected run rate has occurred
==============================================

The expected run rate per hour for this soak is 170 iterations

To check this 
1.Get the total duration the test has been running in hours
2.Check the total number of iterations run (This can be seen by loop_count in above grep for "losf_file_count")
3.Divide the total number of iterations by the duration in hours
