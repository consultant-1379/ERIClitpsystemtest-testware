Create new root crontab on MS or on nodes
 - crontab -e

Populate crontab with command stating what service you want to restart
!!! ONLY ONE OF THESE SERVICES SHOULD BE ADDED AT ANY ONE TIME !!!

Litpd service restart
*/2 * * * * (time /sbin/service litpd restart ; date) >> /tmp/litp_info.txt 2>&1

Puppet Service Restart
*/2 * * * * (time /sbin/service puppet restart ; date) >> /tmp/puppet_info.txt 2>&1

Passenger service Restart
*/2 * * * * (time /sbin/service httpd restart ; date) >> /tmp/passenger_info.txt 2>&1

Mcollective service restart
*/2 * * * * (time /sbin/service mcollective restart ; date) >> /tmp/mcollective_info.txt 2>&1

Postgresql service restart
*/2 * * * * (time /sbin/service postgresql restart ; date) >> /tmp/postgresql_info.txt 2>&1

Puppet DB service restart
*/2 * * * * (time /sbin/service puppetdb restart ; date) >> /tmp/puppetdb_info.txt 2>&1

Celery service restart
*/2 * * * * (time /sbin/service celeryd restart ; date) >> /tmp/celery_info.txt 2>&1


Each of these crontab examples runs every two minutes which would be an
average of 30 per hour.

To change the time of restart simply edit the first numerical value in "*/x"
where x is the number in minutes.

The results will be stored in /tmp in the text files specified at the end of
the command.

To check the file for failed restarts simply use
grep "FAILED\|ERROR"  "file name"

#################################
Start/Stop litp scripts to run together
#################################

Copy over two files from this directory over to /tmp directory on the  systems ms

Average time to start litpd service is 2.0 seconds
Average time to stop litpd service is 2.2 seconds
** times may vary depending on system


You must kick off the start_litp.sh and then one second later kick off the stop_litpd.sh 

(This will ensure that litp service cannot start fully before a stop command interrupts it)

>> sh start_litpd.sh ; sh stop_litpd.sh 

These scripts will run start litpd service and stop litpd service respectively in a loop 10,000 times and will ammend a file litp_info.txt with the results of each command.
 
This will be stored in /tmp directory on the node you run them on. 
When checking the results in /tmp/litp_info.txt a few commands can be run to grep for errors

cat /tmp/litp_info.txt | grep "FAILED"
cat /tmp/litp_info.txt | grep "ERROR"

It is also worth checking the current status of the service , run in this order

service litpd status

service litpd stop

service litpd start

service litpd restart

service litpd status 

kill "PID from previous status"

service litpd start

service litpd status

kill -9 "PID from previous status"

service litp start


** This is to ensure that all commnads relating to this service are still in working order after scripts ran

12927 ADDITIONAL CRON JOB
#################################

Add this cron job to the one chosen above so two cron jobs will be running together


Step 1 : - Make an output directory for the backup:
          
mkdir /tmp/test_backup

Step 2 : Add this cron job to the list of running cron jobs
[root@ms1dot28 ~]# crontab -l
* * * * * /opt/ericsson/nms/litp/bin/litp_state_backup.sh /tmp/test_backup


This will run the backup script every minute over the weekend and place any backups created in /tmp/test_backup

There should only be a maximum of 5 backups present in /tmp/test_backup
