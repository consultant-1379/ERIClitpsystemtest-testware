This extension was created using the variables
EXTENSION_NAME=exampleextapi
EXTENSION_CLASSNAME=ExampleExtApi
EXTENSION_CXP=CXP1234567

This extension defines an item called example-item which extends software-item so that it can be deployed in the model under the /software/items. It has properties:
name - basic_string
size - of type example_byte_size
rubbish - no type defined
example_byte_size is a new PropertyType defined by this extension which expects size to be defined in bytes, e.g. 10B
rubbish has its own PropertyValidator that ensures its not > 10 characters. NB normally for this simple a validator there is a length validator in the core, but this validator was added to prove plugins could write their own validators as per the documentation.

The files changed from the template produced by the archetype are:
ERIClitpexampleextapi/src/exampleext_extension/exampleext_extension.py
ERIClitpexampleextapi/test/test_exampleext_extension.py
