This plugin was created using the variables
PLUGIN_NAME=extorderedtwo
PLUGIN_CLASSNAME=ExtOrderedTwo
PLUGIN_CXP=CXP1234567
It uses items in the core and package extension, and defines an ordered list containing 2 config and 2 callbacks tasks for each package-list it finds under each node where list has name containing ORDTEST
For each packagelist under each node it creates the following files:
Config1 - creates file /etc/example_ord2_conf1_<hostname>_<packagelistname> on each managed node
Config2 - creates file /etc/example_ord2_conf2_<hostname>_<packagelistname> on each managed node
Callback1 - creates file /etc/example_ord2_call1_<hostname>_<packagelistname> on the MS
Callback2 - creates file /etc/example_ord2_call2_<hostname>_<packagelistname> on the MS

Currently creates them in a list as:
callback2,callback1,config2,config1

After LITPCDS-2114 is complete this will be an ordered list.

Files changed from the template are:
ERIClitpextorderedtwo/pom.xml
src/extorderedtwo_plugin/extorderedtwo_plugin.py
ats/example_test.at
